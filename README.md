# Oracle-Apex-Session-Manager-chromeextension
The Oracle Apex Session Manager is a simple Chrome Extension that updates the session IDs in Oracle Apex. It's useful when you're working with an Oracle Apex application that times out a session from time to time, as it allows you to quickly update the session ID in all open tabs.

How it works
When an Apex session times out or logs out, you need to log back in and click on the extension. The extension will then reload all the open tabs with the same app ID (or all backend tabs such as App Builder, SQL Workshop, etc.) with the new session ID. This saves you the time and hassle of manually updating the session ID in each open tab.

Installation
To install the extension, follow these steps:

Clone this repository or download the code as a ZIP file.
Extract the code to a local directory.
Open the Chrome browser and go to the "Extensions" page.
Enable "Developer mode".
Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you extracted the code.
The extension should now be installed and visible on the Chrome toolbar.

Usage
To use the extension, simply click the icon on the Chrome toolbar after logging back in to Oracle Apex. This will reload all open tabs with the new session ID.
